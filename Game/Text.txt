Bored out of your mind one night, you decided to go out on a stroll.
Feeling the need for fresh air, you continue to walk far into the forest.
The scent of cotton candy and popcorn hits your nose. Following the scent, 
you stumble across an enormous red and white striped circus tent. You walk in.
Surrounded by amusing lights and joyous music, you begin to relax. In that
moment...HONK!!hAHahahahha..everything goes dark.
