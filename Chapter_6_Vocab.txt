actual parameter
-aka an argument
-the value given to the parameter
-ex: int z = max(x, y); //a and y are the actual paremeters

ambiguous invocation
-a compile error
-caused when there are two or more matches for the invocation
of a method, but the compiler can't determine which is the best
match.

argument 
-aka an actual parameter
-look above

divide and conquer
-strategy aka stepwise refinement
-decompose into manageable subproblems, that can also be  decomposed
into even more manageable problems.

formal parameter (i.e., parameter)
-the variables defined in method header
-a placeholder so when the method is invoked a value is given to
the parameter

information hiding 225
-aka encapsulation
-client can use the method without knowing how it was implemented

method 204
-consists of a method name, parameter, return value type, and body
-definition consists of a methof header and method body
-syntax:modifier returnValueType methodName(list of parameters) {  
// Method body; 
}

method abstraction 225
-achieved by seperating the use of methods from its implementation
-hides information
-applied to developing programs

method overloading 219
-lets you define the methods with the same name as long as their signatures 
differ
-java complier determines which method to use based on the method
signatures

method signature 205
-the method name and parameter list when put together

modifier 205
-determines whether other classes can use a field or invoke a method

parameter 205
-aka formal parameter
-the variables defined in method header
-a placeholder so when the method is invoked a value is given to
the parameter

pass-by-value 212
-When a method is invoked with an argument, the value of the argument is 
passed to the parameter
-if argument is a variable rather than a literal value, the value of the 
variable is given to the parameter

scope of a variable 
-The part of a program where the variable can be referenced
-starts from its declaration, and stops at the end of the block that contains
the variable

stepwise refinement 
-aka divide and conquer strategy.
-decompose into manageable subproblems, that can also be  decomposed
into even more manageable problems.

stub 
-a simple, but incomplete version of a methof
-used when methods are waiting to be implemented
-used to build a framework for the program
